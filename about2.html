        <br>
          <p>"Take revival to My church." The Lord spoke to my heart after the sixth anniversary of pastoring. 
          Resigning my church and returning to full-time, itinerant ministry was not my idea, but neither was 
          calling me to global ministry.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Mission</h1>
          <p>Declaring and demonstrating the gospel to this generation. By balancing the Word and Spirit of God, 
           we develop believers on eternal principles in relevant language. By making biblical principles easy 
           to understand, we increase the effectiveness of God's promises in our own lives and, in turn, our 
           outreach to our communities. Our passion is to see people, of all walks of life, reach their full 
           potential in Christ.</p>
