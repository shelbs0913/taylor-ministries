          <h2>Jeff Taylor's brand new book, Picking Up Sticks, is now available in hard copy and on Amazon Kindle!
            If you, or someone you know, have ever been injured while serving in a church, you don't want to miss 
            this informative book of recovering your service to God. Jeff utilizes the amazing story of the Apostle 
            Paul on the island of Malta, and a personal testimony, to illustrate how you can turn the enemy's plan 
            into victory for you and for others.</h2>
